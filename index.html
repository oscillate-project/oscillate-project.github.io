      <!-- <p>Oscillate [OSL] is an ASIC resistant fork of TurtleCoin, using the CryptoNight_Turtle algorithm. Quick
        transactions, privacy, Ease of use make this coin perfect for paying anyone, anywhere. Oscillate can also be
        mined on any windows or
        Linux based PC, no matter how strong or weak!</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you do not know what TurtleCoin is, it is a fairly popular cryptonote coin, which is what this was forked
        from. Oscillate was forked from this code for a few reasons.</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li> 1. The code is updated frequently and is always supporting updates for operating systems. </li>
        <br>
        <li> 2. The code is lightweight and can be used on ARM devices. </li>
        <br>
        <li> 3. It is faster than the original cryptonote commit. </li>
        <br>
        <li> 4. An easy to use wallet is included with the release. </li>
      </ul> -->
